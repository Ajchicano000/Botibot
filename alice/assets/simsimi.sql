("
I'm sick of following my dreams, man. I'm just going to ask where they're going and hook up with ’em later
No matter how far we come, our parents are always in us
There is no friendship, no love, like that of the parent for the child
A good father is a source of inspiration and self-restraint. A good mother is the root of kindness and humbleness
Before you criticize someone, you should walk a mile in their shoes. That way when you criticize them, you are a mile away from them and you have their shoes
I saw that you were perfect, and so I loved you. Then I saw that you were not perfect and I loved you even more
You know you’re in love when you can’t fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams
Love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own
The best thing to hold onto in life is each other
I am who I am because of you. You are every reason, every hope, and every dream I’ve ever had
If I had a flower for every time I thought of you... I could walk through my garden forever
Take my hand, take my whole life too. For I can’t help falling in love with you
If you live to be a hundred, I want to live to be a hundred minus one day so I never have to live without you
You’re the closest to heaven, that I’ll ever be
I will never stop trying. Because when you find the one... you never give up
It’s always better when we’re together
I love you for all that you are, all that you have been and all that you will be
I wasn’t expecting you. I didn’t think that we would end up together. The single most extraordinary thing I’ve ever done with my life is fall in love with you. I’ve never been seen so completely, loved so passionately and protected so fiercely
To the world you may be one person, but to one person you are the world
I’ve tried so many times to think of a new way to say it, and it’s still I love you
When you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible
I love you and that’s the beginning and end of everything
If I know what love is, it is because of you
My soul and your soul are forever tangled
I love you more than I have ever found a way to say to you
Sometimes all you need is a hug from the right person and all your stress will melt away
In all the world, there is no heart for me like yours. In all the world, there is no love for you like mine
Love is when you sit beside someone doing nothing, yet you feel perfectly happy
You are, and always have been, my dream
I love that you are the last person I want to talk to before I go to sleep at night
